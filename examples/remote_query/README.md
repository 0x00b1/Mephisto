# Mephisto Remote Query Examples

This directory contains examples of using remote queries. The `template` example consists of the boilerplate with pointers about how the code interacts with the data model (and hints on how to build your own task), while the `mnist` example shows what a functioning model-in-the-loop task would really run like.
